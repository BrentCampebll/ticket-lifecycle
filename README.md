Here I will create a ticket and assign it to an agent.  The Agent will then communicate and escalate the issue if needed.  I started by creating 2 tickets.  One Simple one complex.

<p>
Once assigned Agents will work the tickets and communicate with the customer until the issue is resolved.  Once resolved tickets will be closed.
